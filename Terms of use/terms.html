    <h1>Terms Of Use</h1>
    <p>Netflix provides a personalized subscription service that allows our members to access entertainment content (“Netflix content”) over the Internet on certain Internet-connected TVs, computers, and other devices ("Netflix ready devices").</p>

        <p>These Terms of Use govern your use of our service. As used in these Terms of Use, "Netflix service", "our service" or "the service" means the personalized service provided by Netflix for discovering and accessing Netflix content, including all features and functionalities, recommendations and reviews, our websites, and user interfaces, as well as all content and software associated with our service. References to ‘you’ in these Terms of Use indicate the member who created the Netflix account and whose payment method is charged.</p>

        <h2>Section A: Membership</h2>
        <p>Your Netflix membership will continue until terminated. To use the Netflix service, you must have Internet access and a Netflix ready device, and provide a current, valid, accepted method of payment, which you may update from time to time ("Payment Method").</p>

        <p>Your subscription automatically renews unless you cancel it. Membership plans may vary and include limitations on the number of devices or concurrent streams. Netflix reserves the right to change our plans and pricing or terminate the service entirely.</p>

        <h2>Section B: Billing and Cancellation</h2>
        <p>Billing Cycle. The membership fee for the Netflix service will be charged to your Payment Method on the specific payment date indicated on your "Account" page. The length of your billing cycle will depend on the type of subscription that you choose when you signed up for the service.</p>

        <p>Cancellation. You can cancel your Netflix membership at any time, and you will continue to have access to the Netflix service through the end of your billing period. Payments are non-refundable and we do not provide refunds or credits for any partial-month membership periods or unwatched Netflix content. If you signed up using a third-party as a Payment Method, cancellation may need to be handled through them.</p>

        <h2>Section C: Netflix Service</h2>
        <p>The Netflix service and any content viewed through our service are for your personal and non-commercial use only and may not be shared with individuals beyond your household unless otherwise allowed by your subscription plan. During your Netflix membership, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access the Netflix service and view Netflix content.</p>

        <p>The Netflix service, including the content library, is regularly updated. In addition, we continually test various aspects of our service, including our website, user interfaces, promotional features, and availability of Netflix content. Netflix may allow users to download content to select devices and set limitations on viewing duration or device compatibility.</p>

        <p>You agree not to archive, reproduce, distribute, modify, display, perform, publish, license, create derivative works from, offer for sale, or use (except as explicitly authorized in these Terms of Use) content and information contained on or obtained from or through the Netflix service.</p>

        <h2>Section D: Passwords and Account Access</h2>
        <p>The member who created the Netflix account and whose Payment Method is charged (the "Account Owner") has access and control over the Netflix account and the Netflix ready devices that are used to access our service. To maintain control over the account and to prevent anyone from accessing the account (which would include information on viewing history for the account), the Account Owner should maintain control over the Netflix ready devices that are used to access the service and not reveal the password or details of the Payment Method associated with the account to anyone.</p>

        <p>You are responsible for updating and maintaining the accuracy of the information you provide to us relating to your account. We may terminate or suspend your account to protect you, Netflix, or our partners from identity theft or other fraudulent activity.</p>

        <h2>Section E: Disclaimers of Warranties and Limitations on Liability</h2>
        <p>The Netflix service is provided "as is" and without warranty or condition. In particular, our service may not be uninterrupted or error-free. You waive all special, indirect, or consequential damages related to your use of the Netflix service.</p>

        <h2>Section F: Customer Support</h2>
        <p>If you need assistance with your account, billing, or technical support, please visit the Netflix Help Center on our website. You may also contact Netflix customer service by live chat or by submitting a request form.</p>

        <h2>Section G: Communications</h2>
        <p>We will send you information relating to your account (e.g., payment authorizations, invoices, password or Payment Method changes, confirmation messages, notices) in electronic form only, via email to your provided email address.</p>

        <h2>Section H: Miscellaneous</h2>
        <p>These Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which you reside. You agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of that location. Netflix does not accept any counter-offers to these Terms of Use, and all such offers are hereby categorically rejected. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found to be invalid, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.</p>

        <p>If you have any questions concerning your account, please contact Netflix customer service through the "Help Center" on our website.</p>
